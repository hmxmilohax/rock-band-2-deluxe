(loading_trivia847 "\qRainbow in the Dark\q is about an inability to release tremendous potential, and Dio once said it was inspired by his time singing for Black Sabbath.")
(loading_trivia848 "While it's typically thought of as an inspiring song about facing your challenges head-on, \qHere I Go Again\q is about heartbreak and the loneliness that comes with it. The song documents the breakdown of Coverdale's first marriage.")
(loading_trivia849 "The original 1982 version of \qHere I Go Again\q runs 5:08, building slowly as Coverdale sings over a gospel organ. The 1987 re-record is 3:52 and is the more popular version of the song.")
(loading_trivia850 "\pThe Power of Love\p was featured in the 1985 movie Back to the Future and included on the soundtrack. It plays in a scene where Marty McFly hears it as he rides his skateboard from Doc's house to school.")
(loading_trivia851 "\qThe Power of Love\p is a song that is only featured in compilation albums for the band. Its only appearance on a Huey Lewis studio album is the UK version of Fore!")
(loading_trivia852 "Although the German phrase does not translate to English, 'Du hast' can mean 'you have,' but it can also mean 'you hate.' Therefore the song has two meanings.")
(loading_trivia853 "\qDu hast\q has become one of Rammstein's most popular songs, and can be heard in the soundtrack of The Matrix, as well as in American radio and television.")
(loading_trivia854 "When the BBC used \qSpace Oddity\q during their coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, there was a great fear that if the missions in space didn't go well, this song would suddenly become inappropriate.")
(loading_trivia855 "Bowie wrote this after seeing the 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. The song tells the story of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut who cuts off communication with Earth and floats into space.")
(loading_trivia856 "\qSpace Oddity\q was originally written by Bowie as an acoustic guitar song. It was the producer Gus Dudgeon who turned it into an epic.")

(loading_trivia861 "Josh Homme has stated that the meaning of the song is a mystery. The song title truly describes what it's about, \qNo One Knows\q.")
(loading_trivia862 "Singer Corey Taylor has stated that the lyrics for \qBefore I Forget\q are open to interpretation, which is how he likes it. This song deals with evolution and the nature of man.")
(loading_trivia863 "The line 'Put another dime in the jukebox' was dated by the time Jett released her version, as very few jukeboxes took dimes. 'Quarter' didn't sound good in the lyrics, and as jukeboxes slowly disappeared it didn't matter anyway.")
(loading_trivia864 "Deep Purple bass player Roger Glover had some doubts about the song name \qSmoke on the Water\q: he knew it was great but was reluctant to use it because it sounded like a drug song.")
(loading_trivia865 "This song took inspiration from a fire at a Frank Zappa concert that the band was attending. When the fire died down, a layer of smoke had covered Lake Geneva, which the casino venue overlooked. The haunting image became an inspirational idea for the song title.")
(loading_trivia866 "Finding words to rhyme with 'glass' that fit in a song can be... a pain in the ass.")
(loading_trivia867 "When asked about the song, Debbie stated: 'When we did \qHeart Of Glass\q it wasn't too cool in our social set to play disco. But we did it anyway because we wanted to be uncool.'")
(loading_trivia868 "An earlier 1973 version of \qFly Like an Eagle\q features a more bluesy and less funk-inspired rhythm, with slightly different lyrics. It was eventually re-recorded in 1976.")
(loading_trivia869 "The band made sure to include Yoshimi's real name in the title so that the listener would picture 'a crazy Japanese woman' and thought that would come across with the name.")
(loading_trivia870 "Lead singer Wayne Coyne says the inspiration for the song came from a woman named Yoshimi who played with a Japanese noise-rock group called The Boredoms.")

(loading_trivia875 "Although musically this is quite a jangly and catchy song, its lyrical theme is actually pretty dark. This song is about the quest for power, and how it can have unfortunate consequences.")
(loading_trivia876 "This song is about a girl who is hard to get rid of. Getting through to her that she's not wanted is like getting through crosstown traffic.")
(loading_trivia877 "Because of a bad publishing deal Devo made in 1978, they control only the publishing rights to their songs, but not the perfomance rights. When they allow their songs to be used, they insist on re-recording them so they can keep all the performance rights.")
(loading_trivia878 "Winehouse did eventually try a few more stints in rehab to treat her drug and alcohol addiction, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. She was found dead in her London home in 2011.")

(loading_trivia880 "\qImagine\q is a strong political message sugarcoated in a beautiful melody. Lennon realized the softer approach would bring the song to a wider audience, who hopefully would listen to his message: If you want peace, first you have to imagine it.")
(loading_trivia881 "Lennon was asking us to imagine a place where the things that divide us, like religion and possessions, did not exist. He felt that would be a much better place.")

(loading_trivia883 "\qCold As Ice\q describes a woman who is materialistic and selfish, with the singer warning that her behavior will come back to haunt her someday.")
(loading_trivia884 "Tom Johnston has stated that the song title is sorta based on a small town in Texas that he had forgotten about, named \qChina Grove\q. He also sorta just made up an image of a small town, with a strange name, that had crazy sheriff with a Samurai Sword.")
(loading_trivia885 "The Chinese restaurant mentioned in the song, \qLee Ho Fook\q, was real. It was situated in London's Chinatown, and displayed a photo of Zevon. It closed in 2008.")

(loading_trivia887 "Their critically acclaimed album, Pet Sounds, was mixed not in stereo but in mono - largely because of Brian Wilson's lack of hearing in his right ear.")
(loading_trivia888 "\qGood Vibrations\q seems to describe a really good acid trip, and while there is nothing specifically in the lyrics about drugs, Love admits that the psychedelic vibe was an influence on his writing.")
(loading_trivia889 "Most of The Beach Boys songs featured the vocals of either Mike Love or Brian Wilson, but Carl Wilson was chosen as the lead for this one.")
(loading_trivia890 "This is a great example of a funk song with lyrics supporting the groove. It's not poetry, but Brown's series of single-syllable words are accented to hit the beats and support the song's rhythm.")
(loading_trivia891 "Brown was a singer, songwriter, bandleader, and dancer known as \qThe Godfather Of Soul\q.")
(loading_trivia892 "James Brown's stage moves were legendary, with spins, shuffles and incredibly quick footwork. These moves were emulated by many performers, including Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson.")
(loading_trivia893 "Brown's first group was The Flames, where he played the drums. He sang some lead vocals with other members and soon quickly became their frontman.")
(loading_trivia894 "This song is about taking action to avoid oppression. Marley wrote it with Peter Tosh, and the song was influenced by their upbringing in Jamaica, where they had to fight for respect and acceptance for their Rastafarian religion.")
(loading_trivia895 "Marley was a philanthropist, being very generous with his money. He bought houses and supported many of the poor in Jamaica.")
(loading_trivia896 "Marley's group The Wailers were kicked off a tour in 1973 because they were upstaging the headliners, Sly And The Family Stone.")
(loading_trivia897 "Smash Mouth was more of a punk band when they started, which is apparent on most of the tracks on Fush Yu Mang. \qWalkin' on the Sun\q is an outlier, but since it was the hit, that's the sound they had to emulate.")

(loading_trivia1057 "The duo made some memorable, and pretty bad music videos in the 1980s. Oates has said many times that they were kind of bad on purpose, because he resented having to suddenly be an actor for the new medium... and he wasn't a very good actor.")
;;browneyedgirl

;;allaboutthatbass
(loading_trivia1073 "Not since the Spinal Tap song \qBig Bottom\q has such an analog been made between the low end of the audio spectrum and the rear end of a woman. Unlike Spinal Tap, however, Trainor is celebrating her own posterior, making it a song about confidence and positive body image.")
