# üî® Building (NOT standard download and install)

## NOTE: This is for *building the game*, for developers and contributors. <br/> If you're looking for downloads, [please visit our website](https://rb2dx.milohax.org/).

### Installing Python (Required)

* Head to the [**Python downloads**](https://www.python.org/downloads/), download and install Python (version 3.9 or later).
  * ***Select "Add python.exe to PATH"*** on the installer.

### Initializing the Repo

* Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-2-deluxe/releases)** of this repo and **download `_init_repo.py`**.
  * Make a new **empty** folder, **put `_init_repo.py` in the folder, and run it**. This will pull the repo down for you and make sure you're completely up to date. **This will take some time.**

### ***The folder should look like this once it's done:***

### ‚úÖ ***The Rock Band 2 Deluxe repo is now set up!***

From here, you can make any personal modifications to the game or build it yourself.

* Navigate to `windows_bats` if you're on Windows or `user_scripts` if you're on Linux.
  * Run the `build_` script for your platform of choice to build *Rock Band 2 Deluxe*.
  * Built contents will be in the `_build` folder on the root of the repo.

You can now return to [**Installing on Xenia (Advanced)**](#-installing-on-xenia-advanced) or [**Custom Textures**](#-custom-textures).
